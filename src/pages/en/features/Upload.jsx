      <p>Companies all collect statistical data a little differently, and our system is flexible enough to accept many different formats of data. This lets your users use our system without having to modify their system.
      </p>
      <p>
        These different options can be used interchangeably and at any time for flexible data uploads.

        A downloadable Excel template is available for every statistic in your system. Your users can then work to fill it with the appropriate data and then upload it back into the system in a few steps. This option is great for users that prefer to work in an Excel environment. It is also recommended to use this method if there is a large amount of data to be uploaded.
      </p>

        A statistical template can also be manually filled directly on our Reki system. Pick the product line and date you wish to enter data for and our system will generate a table for you to fill directly on the page. This is great for quickly uploading small amounts of data, or can be used to edit previous data uploads.

        Finally, we can allow the system to accept custom Excel forms of any format. This is great for customers who get their data pre-generated from an internal system. The one-time setup process is as easy as contacting us with a copy of the Excel format that you would like our system to accept.

        Afterward, you will be able to upload that format of Excel anytime in the future.
