      <h3>Tables and Charts</h3>
      <p>You and your users are able to make multiple different tables and charts. You can make tables out of any and all of the data that we have in the system dating back as far as there is data.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different formats of tables to help you analyze your data. There is general sales, showing your sales numbers against the whole of the market. The Market share table shows your growth in every area as compared to the market’s growth. Last there is the Trend table which lets you analyze data over long periods of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within these tables you can make charts. From the general sales table you can make a bar or line chart easily using our ‘quick selection’ tool. This takes the guesswork out of making tables, you only have to choose a parent row to make the chart from and the rest is automatically formatted and created.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a more customizable chart, we have our trend line chart solution. You can make this chart with any number of items over any length of time that you need. This lets you directly compare only the items that are of most interest to you.
