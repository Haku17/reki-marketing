      <p>Having a system be fully online means that you and your members always have access to your statistical data. It also means that there is no need to store the data locally on your computer in complicated file structures.</p>
      <p>When information hits our servers it becomes immediately available to you and once accepted, to your users as well. This means that you are always working with the latest information. No longer do you have to sort through out-of-date Excels.</p>
