        Beta testing is when things really start to feel real! We can do this step in any number of ways depending on your requirements. Most importantly is that some or all of your users get their hands on the system and can use it and give their feedback. Depending on how many users you have or how complicated your old system is, it is possible to keep your old system and Reki running side-by-side as we slowly bring in more users. This gives your users the time they need to make the transition.
