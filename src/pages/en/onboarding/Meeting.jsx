        The process starts with our first meeting, either in person or virtually. We will discuss your current situation and discover all the ways Reki can help. We want to hear about your most common tasks, statistics, and other requirements that you need to complete regularly. Once we have a good understanding of your unique situation we will start to build a beta version of your new system.
